<h1 style="text-align: center;">Abstract Machine Interpreter</h1>
<p style="text-align: center;">Developed by: Francis Isip Bawa (CSC615M G01) </p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
  This is a web-based interpreter for a variety of abstract computational models, 
  each involving different methods of memory storage, memory access, and input-output access.
  A text field is provided to input the machine definition, which includes the .DATA and .LOGIC sections, as well as a text field for the input string. An example of a machine definition is shown below:
</p>

<pre>
  .DATA
  TAPE T1

  .LOGIC
  A] RIGHT(T1) (0/X,B), (Y/Y,D), (1/1,reject)
  B] RIGHT(T1) (0/0,B), (Y/Y,B), (1/Y,C)
  C] LEFT(T1) (0/0,C), (Y/Y,C), (X/X,A)
  D] RIGHT(T1) (Y/Y,D), (#/#,accept), (1/1,reject)

  More information about which memory storage and operations are supported can be at the bottom.
</pre>

<p>
  The following procedures are supported:
  <ul>
    <li>Step by State: This procedure allows you to step through the execution of a program one state at a time.</li>
    <li>Multiple Run: This procedure allows you to run a program multiple times and view the final state of the program.</li>
  </ul>

  To get started, click on the procedure you would like to use from the navigation bar above. <br>
  Currently, you are using the <b>{{type}}</b> procedure.
