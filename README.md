This is a web-based interpreter for a variety of abstract computational models, each involving different methods of memory storage, memory access, and input-output access.

To run the application locally, navigate to the folder where the project is located and enter this command in the terminal: ```bash python /.main.py```

Alternatively, the application is hosted and deployed by PythonAnywhere at [francis-bawa.pythonanywhere.com](http://francis-bawa.pythonanywhere.com)
